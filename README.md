The website was built as a final school project. It serves as a prototype for future lifestyle blog site. The Underscores theme is a skeleton for the site's structure. Advanced Custom Fields and Custom Post Types are used in files: single-book.php, single-ritual.php, archive-book.php and archive-ritual.php. Libraries and frameworks used: Materialize.css, AOS, jQuery LoadingOverlay, anime.js. Additionally, I wanted to test 'headless Wordpress' concept with Wordpress serving as a backend and React as a front-end with the use of Wordpress REST API to fetch one of Custom Post Types('Book'). It is shown in the 'frontend' folder, files 'BookItem.js' and 'Books.js'.
